I am a programmer designing an application. My close friend sarah has heard that I am an expertise at creating mobile applications she need my help to create a android mobile app. My families close friend is an educator who wants to use technology to inspire young people. She envisions an android app that compares users ages to famous figures from history. This app will take a persons age  as input and then match the age to the age of different people in history when they passed away. I am going to set up a version control with GitHub and implement Github Actions for automated testing and building to ensure a robust and maintainable application.
The name of the app will be called ‘the history app’. The ap is intended to educate young people and make them aware of the past and why the present is the way it is now. The display image will consist of textviews , edit text and  buttons. The user will be required to enter an age in one of the text views. Once the user enter an age, it should display information about dead person. There will be a button that you have to click to generate the information, and another button to clear all the information. If you enter an invalid age, then it will display on the screen that you have entered the wrong and and to please enter the correct age. The information such as the history and age was retrieved from the website. It is vitally importance to reference where I have gotten that information because it is someone else’s work. 
In the code, we are going to use arrays. The arrays help us to link the ages of the dead people to their information. When we use the arrays, we are going to display the information. We then have to declare all the ID’s that we have used, the buttons, the text views. After each and every step, we should not forget to reference it correctly. Clear variable declarations improve code readability and make it easier for other developers (and your future self) to understand the purpose of each variable.Meaningful variable names combined with explicit type declarations enhance code maintainability, as it becomes simpler to comprehend and modify code during maintenance or collaboration.

This Kotlin code represents an Android application that displays information about famous deceased individuals based on their ages. Let's break down the code step by step:The MainActivity class extends AppCompatActivity, indicating that it serves as the main activity for the Android application.
Within the class, there are two arrays defined:namesOfDeadPeople This array contains strings representing the names and biographical information of deceased individuals. Each string includes details such as the person's name, birthplace, and cause of death.
agesOfDeadPeople: This array contains integers representing the ages at which the corresponding individuals from the namesOfDeadPeople array passed away.Inside the onCreate method:The enableEdgeToEdge() function (not shown in the provided code) is called, which likely adjusts the display to utilize the device's full screen.
The layout file activity_main.xml is set as the content view for the activity.
Various UI elements (TextViews, EditTexts, and Buttons) are initialized using their respective IDs from the layout file.
An onClickListener is set for the btnzgenerate Button. When this button is clicked, the application retrieves the age entered by the user from the txtAge EditText. buttons play a crucial role in creating interactive user interfaces for Android applications. Understanding the importance of buttons in Kotlin involves recognizing their role in facilitating user interactions, enabling user engagement, and providing feedback within the app. Buttons serve as primary means for users to interact with an Android application. They allow users to trigger actions, submit forms, confirm decisions, or navigate to different parts of the app.By tapping on buttons, users can initiate various operations within the application, such as submitting a search query, sending a message, or saving changes. Buttons enhance user engagement by providing clear and intuitive pathways for users to interact with the app's functionalities.Well-designed buttons with descriptive labels and visually appealing styles encourage users to explore and utilize the features offered by the application.
The if-else statement allows developers to execute different code blocks based on the evaluation of a boolean expression or condition. By evaluating conditions, developers can create logic that responds dynamically to different scenarios or user inputs within an application.if-else statements facilitate decision-making within Kotlin programs by enabling developers to define different outcomes or actions based on the evaluation of conditions.Conditions can be as simple as comparing values or as complex as evaluating multiple conditions using logical operators (&&, ||, !).

If a valid age is entered (not null and within a specified range), the application checks if there is a corresponding entry in the agesOfDeadPeople array. If found, it retrieves the information about the deceased individual from the namesOfDeadPeople array and displays it in the txtDeadPeople. TextView. If no corresponding entry is found, it displays a message indicating that no one died at that age.
If an invalid age is entered (outside the specified range or not a number), the application displays a message prompting the user to enter a correct age.
Another onClickListener is set for the btnClear Button. When clicked, it clears the text entered in the txtAge EditText and clears the text displayed in the txtDeadPeople TextView.
In summary, this code creates an Android application that allows users to enter an age and then displays information about deceased individuals who passed away at that age, based on pre-defined data arrays.
